Contributing to Eclipse Paho
============================

Thanks for your interest in this project.

Project Description:
--------------------

The Eclipse Paho project provides reliable open-source implementations of open and standard messaging protocols aimed at new, existing, and emerging applications for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT).\
Paho reflects the inherent physical and cost constraints of device connectivity. Its objectives include effective levels of decoupling between devices and applications, designed to keep markets open and encourage the rapid growth of scalable Web and Enterprise middleware and applications. Paho contains MQTT publish/subscribe client implementations for use on embedded platforms, along with corresponding server support as determined by the community.
